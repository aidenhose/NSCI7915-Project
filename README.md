Marine environmental conditions impact on plastic typing and abundance
This project is to assess how different environmental variables impact the type and abundance of plastics that are found in areas around Australi and whether there is any correlation between them.

Data was generated as a part of the study by Julia Reisser in 2013 (Reisser, J., Shaw, J., Wilcox, C., Hardesty, B.D., Proietti, M., Thums, M. and Pattiaratchi, C., 2013. Marine plastic pollution in waters around Australia: characteristics, concentrations, and pathways. PloS one, 8(11), p.e80466.). Data was downloaded from the DataDryad website (Reisser, Julia et al. (2014), Data from: Marine plastic pollution in waters around Australia: characteristics, concentrations, and pathways, Dryad, Dataset, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.mt0j5).

Any questions on the dataset should be forwarded through Julia Reisser who was the original author of the study. Contact can be made at julia.reisser@uwa.edu.au

Two datasets are included nettows_info.csv and plastics_info.csv
nettows_info.csv has 32 columns of variables and 171 rows of data. Variable names VesselTripName,NetStation,Replicate,CollectedBy,DateUTC,StartTimeUTC,EndTimeUTC,Duration,NetTypeMeshSizeDimensionsNetMouth,VesselSpeed,VesselDirection,WindSpeed,WindDirection,SeaTemperature,Salinity,Depth,StartLatitude,StartLongitude,EndLatitude,EndLongitude,StartFlowmeter,EndFlowmeter,Flow,HardPlastics,SoftPlastics,PlasticLines,Styrofoam,Pellets,TotalPlastics,DriftingWood,Pumice,Cs
plastics_info.csv has 7 columns of variables and 839 rows of data. Variable names Plastic,NetStation,Replicate,Type,Length,Colour,PolymerType
