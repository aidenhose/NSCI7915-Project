Marine environmental conditions impact on plastic typing and abundance
This project is to assess how different environmental variables impact the type and abundance of plastics that are found in areas around Australi and whether there is any correlation between them.

Data was generated as a part of the study by Julia Reisser in 2013 (Reisser, J., Shaw, J., Wilcox, C., Hardesty, B.D., Proietti, M., Thums, M. and Pattiaratchi, C., 2013. Marine plastic pollution in waters around Australia: characteristics, concentrations, and pathways. PloS one, 8(11), p.e80466.). Data was downloaded from the DataDryad website (Reisser, Julia et al. (2014), Data from: Marine plastic pollution in waters around Australia: characteristics, concentrations, and pathways, Dryad, Dataset, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.mt0j5).
